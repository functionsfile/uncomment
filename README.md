# Uncomment WordPress Plugin

Your one-stop shop for removing WordPress comment functionality.

While WordPress allows you to disable comments site-wide via the comments setting screen, the Uncomment plugin goes one step further and disables or hides all interface elements and functionality related to comments on your WordPress site.

Starting with Uncomment consists of just two steps: installing and activating the plugin. Uncomment is designed to disable or hide commenting functionality from your WordPress site without any additional settings. Uncomment also works great as a must-use plugin.

## FAQ

### Does this plugin remove existing comments?

Uncomment does not remove any existing comments from the database.

### I'm still seeing comments on my site?

Uncomment uses WordPress core actions, filters and functions to hide or disable comments and commment-related elements. It is possible that your theme or another plugin uses its own custom comment elements or functions. In that case, the Uncomment plugin is unable to remove those elements.

If you spot any WordPress core comment functionality that should have been removed by the Uncomment plugin, please let us know by opening an [issue](https://github.com/functionsfile/uncomment/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/functionsfile/uncomment/pulls).

### Can I enable comments for a specific post or post type?

Uncomment is designed to remove all commenting functionality from your WordPress site. There are no additional settings to enable comments for specific posts or post types.
